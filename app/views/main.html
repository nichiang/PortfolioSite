<h2>Hi, I'm Nick</h2>

<p>I'm an UX designer/prototyper/PM, currently working on consumer VR experiences as the Lead UX Designer at <a href="https://www.jauntvr.com">Jaunt VR</a>. I specialize in breaking down complex UX problems, with an emphasis on thinking through user experience problems across hardware and software, from beginning to end.</p>

<p>I love diving deep into HCI problems, with my current focus on designing cross platform VR interactions for devices that range from basic Cardboard headsets, to the highest end desktop VR headsets. In the past, I've worked on touch and stylus interactions, natural user gestures, designing for human factors and cross-device IoT experiences.</p>
